## Ontology
The site is centered as an introduction to Global Warming.  Glboal warming has a description, it has an aboutt section to what it is, it has a history of information. It has a Causes section, a Action section talking about the actions that can be taken, and it has a future section that talks about the future of the earth due to Global Warming.
It is placed like this because the order of information makes sense and is used in places like Wikipedia.
Such as firstly readers get an information about the about section of Global Warming and what it is in general, then they
get information about its history. Then after reading all the user will most likley be curious about causes, then actions that can 
be taken and then the future. 
The survey is a sign up form where after reading about Global Warming the reader can sign up to volunteer at the city they live in.

## Taxonomy

- header: We have  header section that is constant throughout the webpage and tells the reader what website is about
- section: We used content blocks for the different sections of each page to separate the content for the readers.
  It is used for the Z pattern we are using for most of the website
- h1: Used this tag in the header section for the title of the website as it tells the user what this website is for
- nav: Used a nav section for the general navigation of the website and contains all the links. Used general best practices for navigation such as nav , li, ul , href
- footer: The footer contains information about the sources we took our information from. It clearly tells the reader what it is through the h2 tag that says Information Sources. It also says the names of the creators of the website so that the readers can see it

  
### Index page
This page uses a F- layout to show the content and guides the user attention to the volunteer sign up
- div: For the image in the center because it is different
  than the outer 4 sections and is not one of the Z layout 
  focal points
- h2: Is used because it is the heading for the content
  in its section but is under the main site heading
- p: is used because it is a paragraph of text under
  the h2 in its section
  
### Survey
  - Form : to create the whole survey structure in a form
  - input : to get user's input for the various fields of the type
  - input type:  to create different types of buttons such as radio button, checkbox, and text.
 - First Survey: There is a first survey that asks the user if they would like to volunteer. Its placed on the index page so
the user can see it the first thing. It consists of input text box to take information from the user. 
 The text is for getting general information about the user such as name, email. This first survey is the one that is being displayed to the user.
Second Survey: A second survey was made to get more detailed information from the user about the user;s thoughts on Global warming
But to the IA's decision it was not included in the actual website, but its on the githubfor view. 
The radio and checkbox is to get information on how the reader feels about certain things on a range of between 1-5, to
see what the user feels as more relevant information. We shifted towards asking users if they would like to volunbteer for Global Warming ratherthanasking too many questions about particular thoughts. The reason for the shift was that users may not want to always
read all that information and spend so much time filling up a survey. But having a quick volunteer form is very relevant to the content of the website and would be more effective as well.
 
 ### Content Pages
 
 For the content pages we used:
h2 tags : To show what the main title of that page is and what its about
h3 tags: to show if there are major subpoints under the main title of the page. This is only used for the Causes Page.
p tags : For all the content we used this tag to display the information to the user    
  

## Choreography

- The optimal experience for the reader is to come to the index page and read the content and then sign up with the volunteer form thus fulfilling the goal of the website.The F - layout helps with navigating the user's attention to form quickly. Then the reader can take actions to read the content in all the other navigation items and look at the different content. 
The list of actions are: arrive at the index page, scroll down read all the content, then look at the volunteer form to sign up to volunteer against Global warming. Then navigate to the causes page, action page and the future page.
 The admin nav is placed on the left because the reader is most likley to naturally navigate towards the right then the left.
